- distance between line segment, lines, and line + line segment.
- line fitting for 2D and 3D points
- polynomial

- Should the difference between points and vectors be removed? algs seem to turn points into
vectors on a whim.

- Should homographies be included in the main library?  Very specific to computer vision.
